# README

This repo is for a re-build of a 6 page website that includes mobile-friendly responsiveness, blogging, mail_forms and testing built in Rails 5 and Ruby 2.3. The code is free to look over for those interested, and this repo is mostly to help stay productive as I am currently traveling between places and trying to stay productive in my spare time.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.3.0
* Rails version: 5.0.0.1
* Devise for authentication
* mail_form for contact page
* Bootstrap 3 for css styling and changes
* Normalize.css for cross-browser compatability and prettiness
